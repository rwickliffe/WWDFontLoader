# WWDFontLoader

Convenience methods for loading and registering fonts.

## Installation

`WWDFontLoader` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, first be sure the location of this private spec repo is specified in your `Podfile`:

```
source 'https://github.com/rwickliffe/Specs.git'
```

Next, if not already included, you'll now need to specify the official CocoaPods [source](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#source):

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
```

Finally, add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'WWDFontLoader'
```

You may alternatively just copy the contents of the `WWDFontLoader` folder into your project.
